#  Conky & ConkyWeather  #
##################

Are now included 2 verssions of the conky theme
1st version more minimalistic- works better with more backgrounds - and eliminated the overlay problem in gnome-shell 3.9 - 3.9.2
Does not include conky weather - see screenshot1.jpg 
As there is now a really good gnome-shell weather plugin 

2nd version: "Old version" .conkyrc-complete
Rename it in .conkyrc to use it

Feel free to optimize it for your needs - most parts in the script are well documentated
(Thanks for any suggestion)

If you use the minimalistic version (.conkyrc) no need to install conkyforecast
